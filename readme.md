# Flex Engine

An educational game engine written in **C++23** for learning modern graphics programming, real-time rendering, and game engine architecture. Built on **OpenGL 4.6**, Flex Engine provides a clean, approachable codebase to experiment with physically-based rendering, post-processing effects, physics simulation, and scene management.

## Key Features

### Rendering
* **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)**: Metallic-roughness workflow with albedo, normal, emissive, occlusion textures
* **Cascaded Shadow Maps**: 4-cascade directional shadows with PCF filtering
* **HDR Bloom**: Multi-level downsample/blur/upsample pipeline with soft knee threshold
* **Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**: Depth-based AO with configurable radius/bias
* **Depth of Field**: Lens simulation with focal distance, f-stop, and bokeh blur
* **Post-Processing**: Vignette, chromatic aberration, tone mapping, exposure, gamma correction
* **Environment Mapping**: HDR skybox rendering with environment lighting
* **glTF 2.0 Support**: Full scene graph loading with materials, textures, and hierarchy

### Engine
* **Entity-Component-System**: EnTT for high-performance scene management
* **Jolt Physics Integration**: Rigid body dynamics with box/sphere colliders
* **Scene Serialization**: JSON-based save/load with stable entity UUIDs
* **Play/Stop Mode**: Runtime simulation with editor state restoration
* **ImGui Editor**: Docking layout with viewport, hierarchy, properties, statistics
* **Hot-Reload**: Shader recompilation at runtime (Ctrl+R)
* **MSDF Text Rendering**: Sharp text at any scale via multi-channel signed distance fields
* **Transform Gizmos**: ImGuizmo integration for translate/rotate/scale in viewport

### Platform
* **SDL3 Windowing**: Cross-platform window management and input
* **OpenGL 4.6 Core**: Modern rendering API with DSA (Direct State Access)
* **C++23**: Modern language features for clean, maintainable code

### Controls (Default)

* Mouse Right Drag: Orbit camera
* Mouse Middle Drag: Pan
* Mouse Wheel / +/- : Zoom

## Building

### Prerequisites

**Windows**
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (C++23 support required)
- CMake 3.21 or later
- Git (for submodule management)

**Linux**
- GCC 13+ or Clang 16+ (C++23 support)
- CMake 3.21+
- OpenGL development libraries:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxinerama-dev \
                       libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev
  ```

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/Flex.git
cd Flex
```

**If you forgot `--recursive`:**
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Configure and Build

**Windows (Visual Studio):**
```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

**Windows (Ninja - faster builds):**
```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Run

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\build\Flex\Debug\FlexEngine.exe
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./build/Flex/FlexEngine
```

### Build Configurations

- **Debug**: Full debug symbols, assertions enabled, slower performance
- **Release**: Optimizations enabled, no debug symbols, faster performance

Switch configuration by changing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or building with `--config Release`.

## Learning Objectives
